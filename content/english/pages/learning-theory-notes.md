These notes were made while studying Francis Bach's *[Learning Theory from First Principles](https://www.di.ens.fr/~fbach/)*, with the guidance of [Prof. Michael Riis Andersen](https://michaelriis.github.io/). The material is graduate-level, covering the mathematical foundations of why and how machine learning algorithms generalize.

The notes follow Bach's text chapter by chapter. Each chapter includes preliminary definitions, worked derivations, standalone proofs, and a brief discussion of the significance of the results. I also drew on a range of outside sources to supplement proofs and build intuition.

Topics covered include concentration inequalities (Hoeffding, McDiarmid), PAC learning, empirical risk minimization, Rademacher complexity, and optimization for machine learning.
